# 🍴 Online Food Delivery Analysis SQL Project (Beginner Level)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes a **Food Delivery dataset** using SQL to uncover insights about **customers, restaurants, menu items, and orders**.  
It is a beginner-friendly project that strengthens SQL query writing, database schema design, and data visualization skills.

---

## 📊 Dataset & Schema
The project is based on a simple **Food Delivery database** with the following tables:

- **Customers** → customer_id, customer_name, city  
- **Restaurants** → restaurant_id, restaurant_name, city  
- **Menu** → item_id, item_name, price, restaurant_id  
- **Orders** → order_id, customer_id, restaurant_id, order_date  
- **Order_Items** → order_item_id, order_id, item_id, quantity  

**Primary & Foreign Keys:**  
- customers(customer_id) → orders(customer_id)  
- restaurants(restaurant_id) → orders(restaurant_id)  
- menu(item_id) → order_items(item_id)  
- orders(order_id) → order_items(order_id)  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design an **ER diagram** with primary–foreign key relationships  
- Write **15+ SQL queries** to solve real-world business problems  
- Create **visualizations** from query outputs  
- Generate a **final report** with insights  

---

## 🔑 SQL Queries Covered
Some of the key queries written in this project:
1. Total orders per city
2. Revenue generated by each food item
3. Top 5 spending customers
4. Restaurant-wise orders count
5. Average order value by city
6. Monthly order Trends
7. Top 3 cities by Revenue
8. Number of Unique Customer per city
9. Most Frequntly ordered items
10. Restaurants with low order COUNT less than 30 

(Full query list is available in [`queries.sql`](./queries.sql))  

---

## 📈 Visualizations
Sample charts created from query outputs:
- Total Orders per City  
- Monthly Order Trends  
- Revenue by Food Item  
- Top 3 Cities by Revenue  
- Restaurant-wise Order Count  

(Visualizations stored in `/visuals` folder)

---

## 📝 Insights
- Delhi and Mumbai generated the highest revenue.  
- Paneer-based dishes and Biryani were the most frequently ordered items.  
- Average order value varied significantly across cities.  
- Top 5 customers contributed a major share of total revenue.  
- Restaurants with fewer than 30 orders can be considered low-performing.
